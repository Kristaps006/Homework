    <h3 class="title">The Problem wih traditional practise</h3>
    <p class="description">
        We’ve all had to practice a skill at some point — piano lessons, school sports teams, on-the-job training. You might associate the word “practice” with rote, never-ending repetition — piano scales, sports drills — and the frustration of not making much progress. There’s a reason so many people give up on learning a new skill or only reach a middling level of competence: inevitably, improvement stalls.

    <p class="description">

            In some circles, golfer Ben Hogan is credited with “inventing practice.” Hogan methodically broke the game of golf down into chunks and figured out how he could master each section. Today, experts have a new term for his rigorous style of improvement. <a href="https://jamesclear.com/beginners-guide-deliberate-practice">Read more…</a>

    <h3 class="title">Can you achieve anything with Deliberate Practise?</h3>
    <p class="description">
        Deliberate practice <strong>does not mean</strong> that you can fashion yourself into anything with enough work and effort, though.
